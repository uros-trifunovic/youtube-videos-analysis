YouTube uses factors including but not limited to the number of views, comments, and likes to determine which videos a wide range of viewers would find interesting. These videos are listed as “Trending” and pushed to the platform users. The list gets updated roughly every 15 minutes.

The analysis looks into the trending YouTube videos in the United States to determine which factors influence videos’ popularity the most. Furthermore, it attempts to construct a model for predicting the number of views for the videos trending in the United States.

The analysis explores the relationship view count has with continuous variables such as likes, dislikes, and comments. Next, it examines the categorical variables like channel, category, and tags. Lastly, the analysis looks into the publishing times to see whether posting a video at a particular time of the day is favorable for getting more views on a video. 

The data was obtained from kaggle.com.
